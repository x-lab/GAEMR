# GAEMR
Genome Assembly Evaluation, Metrics and Reporting

GAEMR is a complete genome analysis package that helps you evaluate and report on a genome assembly's completeness, correctness, and contiguity.

For more information see http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/gaemr/

## Usage
After download and expanding software package, you must do these 3 things:
1.)  Amend your UNIX PATH environmental variable to point to your installation of the GAEMR/bin dir (e.g. setenv PATH /my/path/to/GAEMR/bin:$PATH)
2.)  Amend your UNIX PYTHONPATH environmental variable to point to your installation of the GAEMR dir (e.g. setenv PYTHONPATH /my/path/to/GAEMR:$PYTHONPATH)
3.)  Change the path variables in the GAEMR/gaemr/PlatformConstant.py to reflect your installation for the various bioinformatics tools.
